**Workflow Overview**
This shows the complete automation flow from trigger to final action. Each pill represents an n8n node — follow them left to right to understand what the workflow does before you build it. The description below explains how the nodes connect.

## step-by-step.png
**Step-by-Step Guide**
Numbered instructions for building the workflow from scratch. Each step includes the node to add, settings to configure, and any expressions needed. Follow these in order to recreate the automation yourself.

## code-block.png
**The Code**
Copy-paste ready code snippets and expressions used in the workflow. Each block has a label showing where it goes (which node/field) and a copy button for quick use. These are the exact expressions you'll paste into n8n.

## key-concepts.png
**Key Concepts**
Important programming and automation concepts used in this workflow. Each card explains a technique (like cron expressions or ternary operators) with a brief description. Review these to understand the "why" behind each step.

## get-workflow.png
